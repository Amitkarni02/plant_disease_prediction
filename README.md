 I have  built a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch. For this task, I have used Keras to help us build a neural network that can accurately identify diseases in a plant through images.

I have  used the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset, which contains 1,530 images divided into train, test, and validation sets. The images are labeled as “Healthy“, “Rust“, and “Powdery“ to describe the conditions of the plants.

Very briefly, each class means the following:

• Rust: These are plant diseases caused by Pucciniales fungi, which cause severe deformities to the plant.

• Powdery: Powdery mildews are caused by Erysphales fungi, posing a threat to agriculture and horticulture by reducing crop yields.

• Healthy: Naturally, these are the plants that are free from diseases.
